# Benchmarks

Performance baseline for ygo, ported from the canonical
[`dmonad/crdt-benchmarks`](https://github.com/dmonad/crdt-benchmarks)
suite. Same benchmark IDs (B1.1, B1.2, ... B4) and same workload
shapes so cross-implementation comparison stays apples-to-apples.

## Running

```
# All benchmarks (skips B4 if trace not present)
go test -bench=. -benchmem ./benchmarks/

# A single benchmark
go test -bench=B1_1 -benchmem ./benchmarks/

# More samples for stability
go test -bench=. -benchtime=5x -benchmem ./benchmarks/

# B4 needs the upstream trace (3.2 MB, gitignored)
node testdata/gen/fetch-b4-trace.mjs
go test -bench=B4 -benchtime=1x -timeout=600s ./benchmarks/
```

Each benchmark ID runs five sub-benchmarks:

- `ops` — time the workload (mutations into a fresh Doc); also
  reports `docBytesV1` / `docBytesV2` (encoded doc size in bytes)
  as custom metrics.
- `encode_v1` / `encode_v2` — time `EncodeStateAsUpdate` /
  `EncodeStateAsUpdateV2` against the pre-built doc.
- `parse_v1` / `parse_v2` — time `ApplyUpdate` / `ApplyUpdateV2`
  on a fresh receiver doc against the encoded bytes.

## Search-marker delta

Before-and-after comparison for the search-marker rollout (post-V2
baseline `cb5b210` → search-marker commit). Same hardware,
`-benchtime=3x` for B1, `-benchtime=1x` for B4. "ops" sub-bench
only (encode/parse paths unaffected by markers).

| ID                              | Before (ms) | After (ms) | Change |
|---------------------------------|------------:|-----------:|-------:|
| B1.3  Prepend chars             |        0.75 |       1.19 |   +59% |
| B1.4  Random insert chars       |       67.59 |      44.02 |   -35% |
| B1.5  Random insert words       |      135.09 |      93.03 |   -31% |
| B1.10 Prepend numbers           |        0.67 |       0.76 |   +13% |
| B1.11 Random insert numbers     |       58.17 |      37.55 |   -35% |
| B2.1  Concurrent insert at 0    |      732.57 |     726.18 |    -1% |
| **B4  Real-world LaTeX trace**  |   **83,593**|  **10,540**| **-87%** |

The B4 result is the headline — 8× speedup on the canonical
real-world workload. (Historical snapshot of the markers change
in isolation; current main measures ~20.3 s on B4 because
commit-time squash + GC later added per-commit work — see the
B4 table and notes below.) Random-insert workloads improved 30-35%
because the per-edit walk distance drops from O(N) to O(local
delta from previous edit). Prepend-only workloads show small
regressions (a few hundred ns/op) attributable to the marker
bookkeeping overhead — prepends keep idx=0 so markers never get
populated and the cost is pure overhead. Absolute numbers tiny;
acceptable trade-off given the B4 win.

## Baseline (Apple M3, Go 1.26.3, `-benchtime=3x`, post-search-marker build)

All times in ms (1 ms = 1,000,000 ns); doc sizes in bytes.

## Notes & observations

- **V1 doc size is now competitive after commit-time squash + GC.**
  The former large V1 overhead on fine-grained text is gone: B1.1
  (append-only) drops 35,880 → 6,013 bytes, level with V2, because
  per-character inserts merge into single items at commit. On the B4
  real-world trace V1 falls from 1.97 MB to 223 KB (about 8.8× smaller),
  putting V1 within ~1.4× of V2 instead of ~8.7× larger. Prepend-only
  (B1.3) still favours V2 because reverse-order inserts do not form
  mergeable runs.

- **Garbage collection shrinks delete-heavy documents.** B1.6 (insert
  then delete everything) is now 18 bytes in V1: deleted content is
  freed at commit and replaced with a compact deleted marker, the same
  GC yjs performs. The B4 trace, which is mostly edits (insert + delete),
  benefits in both formats.

- **V2 still wins on RLE-friendly mixed workloads** (random inserts,
  B1.4 / B1.5) where column encoding dedupes structure squash cannot
  reach, and its slight per-insert column overhead (B1.2, B1.9) is
  unchanged. Choose V2 for persistence and large-document sync; V1 is
  now a reasonable default for live sync traffic.

- **V2 encode time can be higher than V1** on word-heavy or
  string-column-heavy workloads (B1.5: 5.93 vs 0.33 ms; B4: 10.5 vs
  0.6 ms) because of `StringEncoder` UTF-16 length computation and
  per-key staging. V1 just emits varstrings inline. Workloads with
  many small distinct strings (each going through the column key
  table) pay this most.

- **B2.1 is the YATA concurrent-tie-break worst case** — two peers
  both inserting at index 0 means every block has to compare against
  every same-position predecessor on integrate. This benchmark
  doubles as an integration-loop stress test; ~730 ms ops + ~760
  ms parse is dominated by integrate's per-block O(n) scan against
  the conflict set.

- **B3.x scales gracefully** because each per-client update is a
  single Map.Set — only one block per merge, so the integrate cost
  stays sub-linear in client count.

- **B4 op-throughput** is ~0.078 ms / edit (259,778 ops / 20.3 s).
  The history: ~0.32 ms / edit pre-search-markers, ~0.041 ms / edit
  with markers, roughly doubled back when commit-time squash + GC
  landed (every commit now runs a merge scan and a GC pass over the
  transaction's blocks). That CPU buys the 8.8× smaller V1 document,
  the right trade for sync traffic. Against yrs's published sub-10-s
  B4 numbers this sits at roughly 2× — AT the DESIGN.md "within 2×
  of yrs" boundary, not comfortably under it; the commit pipeline
  has known optimization headroom (the squash scan re-walks the full
  new-block range per commit).

## Comparison with yjs / ywasm (published numbers)

`dmonad/crdt-benchmarks` publishes results for `yjs` (the npm
JS package, the canonical reference) and `ywasm` (yrs compiled
to WASM, called from JS via wasm-bindgen). The published numbers
were measured on **Intel® Core™ i5-8400 @ 2.80 GHz × 6 with
Node 20.5.0**. Ours were measured on **Apple M3 with Go 1.26.3**.
Hardware and runtime differ, so this is not an apples-to-apples
benchmark — but it places ygo in the same order of magnitude
on the canonical workload and identifies where the remaining
gaps are.

B4 (real-world LaTeX paper trace, 259,778 edits → 104,852-char
document):

| Metric                | yjs (Node)  | ywasm (WASM) | ygo V1 | ygo V2 |
|-----------------------|------------:|-------------:|-------:|-------:|
| Apply edits (ms)      |       5,714 |       28,675 | 20,259 | 20,259 |
| Encode (ms)           |          11 |            3 |    0.6 |   10.5 |
| Parse (ms)            |          39 |           16 |    4.4 |    4.5 |
| Doc size (bytes)      |     159,929 |      159,929 | **223,414** | **159,921** |
| Memory used (MB)      |         3.2 |          0.0 |    n/a |    n/a |

Notes:

- **ywasm is NOT a fair representative of native yrs.** wasm-
  bindgen adds substantial overhead (~5× on this workload per
  the table above); native yrs's own benchmarks ship sub-1-second
  B4 numbers. A direct ygo-vs-native-yrs run under identical
  hardware is on the roadmap but not yet executed.
- **ygo V1 doc size is within ~1.40× of yjs's V1** (223,414 vs
  159,929 bytes). The historical ~12× bloat (1.97 MB, visible in
  this table before June 2026) is resolved: commit-time block
  squash merges per-character insert runs at commit, and GC frees
  deleted content, the same merging yjs performs. The remaining
  1.4× gap comes from runs that cross transaction boundaries less
  favourably than yjs's in-memory merge timing.
- **ygo V2 doc size matches yjs byte-for-byte-scale** (159,921 vs
  159,929 bytes — parity). V2's per-column RLE compression plus
  commit-time GC dedupe everything the squash reaches and more.
  V2 is the right choice for persistence and snapshots.
- **Apply throughput is ~3.5× yjs's wall-clock on different
  hardware** (20.3 s on Apple M3 vs 5.7 s on the slower i5-8400,
  so the hardware-normalized gap is wider). It was ~1.85× before
  commit-time squash + GC landed; the per-commit merge and GC
  scans roughly doubled apply time, in exchange for the 8.8×
  smaller V1 documents. Relative to yrs's published sub-10-s B4
  numbers this sits at roughly 2× — at the DESIGN.md target
  boundary. Known optimization headroom: the squash scan re-walks
  the full new-block range each commit.
- **Encode V2 is ~17× slower** than encode V1 (10.5 vs 0.6 ms)
  because of `StringEncoder` UTF-16 length computation and per-key
  staging. With squash shipped, V1 encode is both the fastest and
  the hot-path default; V2 remains the persistence format where
  its size parity with yjs pays.

A proper cross-impl harness that runs ygo + native yrs +
yjs through a single comparison runner under identical
hardware is on the [tech-debt list](docs/tech-debt.md). The
numbers above are honest absolute figures with hardware
caveats; a head-to-head harness is a "later" optimization.

## Reproducing

The benchmarks are deterministic per Go's `math/rand` seed. Each
ID uses a distinct seed (B1.4 → 14, B1.5 → 15, B1.7 → 17, B1.11 →
111, B2.2 → 221/222, etc.) so re-runs produce stable byte counts.
Use `-count=N` to gather multiple samples for statistical
comparison via `benchstat`:

```
go test -bench=. -benchtime=5x -count=5 -benchmem ./benchmarks/ | tee bench.txt
benchstat bench.txt
```
